meteor-sharejs
==============

Meteor smart package for transparently adding ShareJS editors to an app. Includes the [Ace editor](http://ace.c9.io/).

Demo app: http://documents.meteor.com (source: https://github.com/mizzao/meteor-documents-demo)

## Install

```
$ mrt add sharejs
```

## Usage

Currently, no configuration necessary.

Use this helper on the client to get a `textarea` with the specified `docid` (as an argument) and with a DOM id of "editor", for example:

```
{{sharejsText docid id="editor"}}
```

Use this helper to get an Ace editor. Make sure you specify a size (via CSS) on the #editor div or you won't see anything.
```
{{sharejsAce docid id="editor"}}
```

The templates will clean themselves up when re-rendered (i.e., you have several documents and docid changes.)

### Configuration

For the Ace editor, define a custom callback in the options hash and pass it in to configure the editor after it is rendered.
```
{{sharejsAce document callback=config id="editor"}}
```

 Note that the helper has to return a function inside of a function:
```
Template.foo.config = ->
  (editor) ->
    # Set some reasonable options on the editor
    editor.setShowPrintMargin(false)
    editor.getSession().setUseWrapMode(true)
```

## Persistence

By default, the documents and edit operations will be persisted in Meteor's Mongo database.

To use Redis to persist the documents, fire up a Redis instance and put the following in your settings file. Make sure to run meteor with the settings: `meteor --settings yoursettings.json`.

```js
"sharejs": {
    "options": {
        "db": {
            "type": "redis"
            "host": "127.0.0.1" // optional
            "port": 6379 // optional
        }
    }
}
```

You can also use `db.type` of `none` to have all documents and operations in memory.

## Meteor User-Accounts Integration

In case you are using Mongo to mirror the internal sharejs DB with an external Meteor collection as in the user-accounts demo app (find it [here](https://github.com/kbdaitch/meteor-documents-demo) deployed on [meteor](http://documents-users.meteor.com)), both, authorization and authentication, are available using sharejs auth mechanism.

The use of this feature becomes effective if you store addional metadata such as owners and invites in the document collection like [here](https://github.com/kbdaitch/meteor-documents-demo/blob/master/client/client.coffee#L22) in the demo app.

Your settings file should look like the following:

```js
{
  "public": {
    "sharejs": {
      "user_accounts_auth": true
    }
  },
  "sharejs": {
    "options": {
      "user_accounts_auth": {
        "authorize": {
          "criteria": {
            "collection": "documents",
            "token_validations": {
              "or": {
                "invitedUsers": "is_in_array",
                "userId": "is_equal"
              }
            },
            "apply_on": [
              "read",
              "update",
              "create",
              "delete"
            ]
          }
        },
        "authenticate": {
          "criteria": {
            "collection": "users",
            "token_validations": {
              "_id": "is_equal"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Client-side settings

* `public.sharejs.user_accounts_auth`: this enables client side sending of `Meteor.userId()` as sharejs authentication token.

### Server-side settings

All authorize and authenticate settings are under their respective categories. Please note that both of them are completely optional, however once present, they must have at least `criteria.collection`.

* `sharejs.options.user_accounts_auth.authorize`
* `sharejs.options.user_accounts_auth.authenticate`

The sub-categories for both operate similarly.

* `criteria`: logic for allowing/rejecting authorization.
* `criteria.collection`: database collection to fetch the document/user metadata from.
* `criteria.token_validations`: contains the boolean logic and supports the keywords `is_equal`, `isnt_equal`, `is_in_array` and `isnt_in_array`. Both `or` and `and` logical operators can be used, provided at any one level of JSON, there is only one or none of them.
* `criteria.apply_on`: you can select operations from [here](https://github.com/share/ShareJS/wiki/User-access-control#actions) `Type` column except `connect` which is reserved for authentication.

### Validations

All validations are run against the token. The client-side of sharejs auth would use `Meteor.userId()` for the token. So, for a returned document from database, the following will check for equality of `userId` and token or presence of token in `invitedUsers`.

```js
"token_validations": {
  "or": {
    "userId": "is_equal",
    "invitedUsers": "is_in_array"
  }
}
```

### Authentication

In my view, the presence of the user in the collection is enough for letting them connect to sharejs. However, criteria such as the following in above example is left as a placeholder for you to decide.

```js
"token_validations": {
  "_id": "is_equal"
}
```

## Advanced

You can access the [ShareJS Server API](https://github.com/share/ShareJS/wiki/Server-api) at `ShareJS.model`. For example, you may want to delete documents ops when the document is deleted in your app. See the demo for an example.

## Notes

- When using the default mongo driver, you must not use collections called `docs` or `ops`. [These are used by ShareJS](https://github.com/share/ShareJS/blob/v0.6.2/src/server/db/mongo.coffee).
- There's currently no security on this; ShareJS is agnostic to the Meteor users. The document ids are used for access.
- It's best to create a `Meteor.Collection` for your documents which generates good unique ids to connect to ShareJS with. Use these to render the templates above. See the [documents demo](https://github.com/mizzao/meteor-documents-demo) for examples.
- Importing ace dependencies is somewhat unsatisfactory. Waiting for improvements to Meteor package management system.
- We should integrate ShareJS auth with Meteor accounts, but these randomly generated ids are safe for most use cases.
